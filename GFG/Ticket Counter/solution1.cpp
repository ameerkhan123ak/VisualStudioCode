/*
N people from 1 to N are standing in the queue at a movie ticket counter. It is a weird counter, as it distributes tickets to the first K people and then the last K people and again first K people and so on, once a person gets a ticket moves out of the queue. The task is to find the last person to get the ticket.

Example 1

Input:
N = 9
K = 3
Output:
6
Explanation:
Starting queue will like {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. After the first distribution queue will look like {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. And after the second distribution queue will look like {4, 5, 6}. The last person to get the ticket will be 6.
Example 2

Input:
N = 5
K = 1
Output:
3
Explanation:
Queue start as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {2, 3, 4, 5} -> {2, 3, 4} -> {3, 4} -> {3}
Last person to get ticket will be 3.
