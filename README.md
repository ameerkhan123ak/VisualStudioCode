# Code Repository

Welcome to my code repository! This repository contains a collection of code snippets and projects that I have worked on and studied. Here, you'll find examples in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and JavaScript.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the programming languages. Each language has its own folder, making it easy to navigate and locate specific code examples. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

- `/c`: Contains C code examples and projects.
- `/cpp`: Includes C++ code snippets and projects.
- `/java`: Contains Java code samples and projects.
- `/javascript`: Contains JavaScript code examples and projects.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the code in this repository. You can browse the directories to find specific programming language folders and then explore the code files within them. Each code file typically includes comments and explanations to provide context and clarify the purpose of the code.

If you find any code snippet or project that interests you, simply navigate to the corresponding directory and access the code file. You can then view, download, or copy the code as needed.
